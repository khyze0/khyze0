CIS-7-Project

Case 1: Inland Empire Solar Sales Travel

Project Description: This project focuses on helping a solar marketing specialist travel efficiently between four cities: Riverside, Moreno Valley, Perris, and Hemet. The program calculates all possible travel routes, determines the distances for each route, and finds the shortest path.

Programming Approach:

Graph Representation:

The distances between cities are stored in a matrix for quick access.
Route Calculation:

All possible travel routes are generated using permutations.
The distance for each route is calculated, including the return to the starting city.
Shortest Path:

The program identifies and displays the shortest route with its total distance.
Output:

The program displays the distance matrix, all routes with distances, and highlights the shortest path.
